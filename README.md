# Vigna-pan-genome

Here, we *de novo* assembled 11 representative *Vigna* accessions from 580 collected accessions. We established the importance of pan-genome variation in mung bean domestication and improvement for important agronomic traits. We constructed a graph-based genome and performed large-scale genome-wide association studies for many traits across multiple years. This work identifies key agronomic genes for mung bean improvement at different geographical locations; which will facilitate the genomics-assisted breeding for mung bean improvement.
